# Noroff Assignment 1 JS: Komputer Store :computer:

This is a basic frontend application developed using vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap.

## Description

The application is a store for purchasing used computers. It consists of four sections, the Bank, Work, Laptop selection, and Purchase sections. The Bank section allows you to check your current bank balance and get a loan. The Work section allows you to work and earn money by clicking on the "Work"-button. As the button is clicked the accumulated pay is displayed. The pay can be transferred to the bank by clicking the "Bank"-button. This allows you to purchase a laptop when the bank balance is sufficient. The Laptop selection section is where you select the laptop you want to display more information about. When a laptop is selected, the purchase section displays some additional information about the laptop (including an image) and you're able to purchase the laptop by clicking the "Buy Now"-button.
