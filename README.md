# Noroff Assignment 1 JS: Komputer Store :computer:

This is a basic frontend application developed using vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap. The application has been deployed to Azure App Services and can be found [here](https://noroff-assignment-1.azurewebsites.net/).

## Description

The application is a store for purchasing computers. You have to work (by pressing the "Work" button) in order to earn money to purchase a computer. When your pay increases, you'll be able to transfer your money to your bank (by pressing the "Bank" button). After transferring money to the bank, you'll have a bank balance. With a bank balance you can take out a loan of up to double you balance. When you have a loan and you want to transfer your earnings to the bank, 10% of your pay will go to a down payment on the loan. You can also pay the entire loan by pressing the "Downpay Loan" button. You cannot get a loan if you already have one. When you have a bank balance, you can buy a computer from the store by selecting one and pressing the "Buy Now" button.
